            <p class="fw-bold">I strongly oppose the conviction crackers should be burnt to express happiness. There are many ways to express happiness, but what is the point of expressing happiness at the cost of harming the environment, people who are sensitive to noise and smoke, and animals. <em>The loud noises from crackers scares animals and is known to raise stress levels and cause discomfort, especially for people suffering with heart disease or older people.</em> The smoke from crackers pollutes the air and impairs visibility. The short-term effects might not be seeming too harmful, but in the long run, this affects the environment and every living being. The inhalation of smoke can cause lung diseases, escalate blood pressure, or worsen the health of heart patients. It might symbolize joy for someone, but it causes discomfort to so many. There are so many ways to illuminate the night sky in peaceful ways, like flying lanterns. Children enjoy it because they lack the understanding of the impact crackers have one other people, animals, and the environment. <br><br>Children adopt the habits that they see around themselves, So, if we teach them the right thing, children would not really enjoy bursting crackers as itâ€™s children like them who are often put at work in harmful conditions to make these crackers. Anyone who cares for mother nature, fellow humans, and animals would never need such a selfish means of happiness. There are better ways of expressing happiness than bursting crackers, like donating to the needy, distributing sweets, gifts, celebrating with the people we love, or something as simple as being kind to other people.
